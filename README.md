# Comparative structural and evolutionary studies of synaptic vesicle proteins including synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 family, synaptophysin, synaptogyrins, and their AlphaFold3 predicted water-soluble QTY variants

##Abstract

Proteins within synaptic vesicles, including the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 family, synaptophysin, and synaptogyrins, are crucial for neurotransmitter release and overall synaptic function, influencing numerous neurological and physiological processes. Although these proteins are vital and hold promise as therapeutic targets, their study is complicated due to their location within the cell membrane. To overcome these difficulties, we performed structural bioinformatics and evolutionary analyses on these synaptic vesicle proteins and their water-soluble variants, which were designed using the QTY code. This approach involves systematically replacing hydrophobic amino acids L (leucine), V (valine), I (isoleucine), and F (phenylalanine) with hydrophilic amino acids Q (glutamine), T (threonine), and Y (tyrosine).

The QTY variants generated in our study, despite having significant differences in their transmembrane sequences (ranging from 45.34% to 54.65%), exhibited similar values for both isoelectric points (pI) and molecular weights. The modification substantially reduced their hydrophobic surfaces without causing major structural alterations. AlphaFold3 predictions indicated that these QTY variants maintained remarkable structural similarity, with RMSD values between 0.434Å and 1.872Å.  Furthermore, our research identified several QTY and reverse QTY variants in genomic databases, which we examined for their phenotypic and topological properties. By integrating evolutionary statistics, we provided new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of alpha-helices with diverse chemical properties. Our data suggest that QTY variants of synaptic vesicle proteins could be valuable assets for research in structural biology, evolutionary studies, and medicine, potentially leading to innovative therapeutic strategies for a range of conditions.
